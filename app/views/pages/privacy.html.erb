We are committed to providing you the best online shopping and delivery experience possible. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how that information is used, under what circumstances we share information, and the choices you can make about that information. This Policy applies whether you access Refresh through a browser, through a mobile app, or through some other method.
<br /><br />
<h3>Information we collect</h3>
<hr />
1. Information you provide to us or allow others to provide to us. 
<br /><br />
At various points in the Refresh experience, you may provide us with information about yourself. For example, when you create an account with Refresh, you provide us with personal information like your name, email address, and zip code. And if you place an order with Refresh, we collect information including your address, phone number, sex, age, credit card information, and the details of your order. 
<br /><br />
If you log into the Refresh service through a third-party, we may receive some information about you through them. For example, if you choose to log into Refresh with your Facebook account, we may receive information about your contacts. We may also offer social sharing tools (such as the Facebook “Like” button) that let you share actions on Refresh with other sites and vice versa. You should check the privacy policies of these services and your settings there for more information. 
<br /><br />
2. Technical information about usage of Refresh 
<br /><br />
When you use the Refresh services, either through a browser or mobile app, we automatically receive some technical information about the hardware and software that is being used. 
<br /><br />
Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies: We and our partners use various technologies to collect information, including cookies and device identifiers. Cookies are small text files that are sent by your computer when you access our services through a browser. We may use session cookies (which expire when you close your browser), persistent cookies (which expire when you choose to clear them from your browser), and other identifiers to collect information from your browser or device that helps us personalize your experience and remember things like your current zip code or that you have already logged in to Refresh. 
<br /><br />
We employ some third-party services to help us understand the usage of Refresh, and these third-parties may also deploy cookies on our site or collect information through our mobile applications. For example, we use Google Analytics to understand, in a non-personal way, how users interact with various portions of our site — you can learn more about information that Google may collect. 
<br /><br />
Log information: When you use Refresh, our servers will record information about your usage of the service and information that is sent by your browser or device. Logs information can include things like the IP address of your device, information about the browser, operating system and/or app you are using, unique device identifiers, pages that you navigate to and links that you click, searches that you run on Refresh, and other ways you interact with the service. If you are logged into the Refresh service, this information is stored with your account information. 

<br /><br />
<h3>How we use your information</h3>
<hr />
We may use the information we collect for various purposes, including to: 
<br /><br />
Provide the Refresh service to you and to improve the quality of the service we’re able to offer Allow your Personal Shopper (which includes those that shop for and deliver the order on your behalf) to choose your items at a retailer site, deliver your items to you, and call or text you with any updates or problems Charge you for the purchase and delivery costs through one or more payment processing partners Offer you customized content (including advertising and promotions), such as prominently displaying items you purchase frequently. Understand how users interact with our service as a whole in order to test new features and improve Refresh for everyone Provide customer service, respond to your communications and requests, and contact you about your use of Refresh (Note: You can opt-out of receiving promotional communications from Refresh by using the settings on the Account Info page) 

<br /><br />
<h3>What we share</h3>
<hr />
Refresh is a platform that connects users with Personal Shoppers who shop for and deliver the goods that you want from retailers. In order to make this work, we need to share information about you and your order with the other parties who help enable the service. This includes, for example, the Personal Shopper(s) who pick and deliver your order, and the payment processing partner(s) that we use to validate and charge your credit card. To be clear, only our payment processing partner(s) receive any credit card information. 
<br /><br />
We also share information under the following principles: 
<br /><br />
With your consent or at your direction — We will share your information with entities outside of Refresh when we have your consent to do so or it is done at your direction. For example: If you enter loyalty card information from a particular retailer, we share that information with the retailer you chose along with your order so that information can update your loyalty card account. If you share a recipe publicly on Refresh, it is viewable by anyone along with your first name and last initial. If you invite friends to use Refresh through our referral program or to share a shopping cart, we will share some information with the friends you invite like your name and picture. Likewise if you choose to join someone else’s cart, they will see some of your information. For external processing — We sometimes employ third parties outside of Refresh to process information on our behalf in compliance with this Privacy Policy and using other appropriate security and confidentiality measures For legal purposes — We share your information when we believe that the disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal process, or requests from law enforcement or regulatory authorities, (b) prevent, detect, or otherwise handle fraud, security, or technical issues, and (c) protect the safety, rights, or property of any person, the public, or Refresh. On a non-personal or aggregate basis — We share information with retailers and advertisers on both a non-personally identifying basis (including order and delivery details but not including credit card information) and an aggregate basis. To enable purchase of alcohol — When you buy alcohol using Refresh, we may be required by law to share certain information with the retailer who makes the sale. This information could include, among other things, the names and addresses of the purchaser and recipient, state ID information, the quantity, brand, price, proof, and volume of alcohol purchased, and a recipient signature. For business purposes — We may share your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company. We may also share your information between and among Refresh, and its current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership. 
<br /><br />

If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this Policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as a notice on our homepage or sending you a notification).
